The user can select from one of the answer options and test their knowledge of array iterator methods. Follow the instructions for setting up a game in the SETUP section bellow.

## Setup

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub). 

```bash
git clone [remote-address] 
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and type:

```

Once the game has started, use your UP and DOWN arrow keys to highlight your selection and push enter to submit your choice.
